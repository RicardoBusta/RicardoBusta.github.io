During the Virtual Reality discipline, we had to develop an application that used some VR techniques. We opted to use the HMD (Head Mounted Display) that was lying around in the lab, a VR1280 from _Virtual Realities_.

We also tested a huge 3D television, one of the first ones. It was quite hard creating stereo images for it, as it's input came from a single source, and you had to create a checkerboard pattern using stencil buffer to send both images at the same time. Even pixels for one eye, odd pixels for the other one.

For the application itself, we decided to create a duck shooting range, where the little ducks would be passing around while you shoot them with a cork rifle.

The majority of programming was done by Cecilia Costa, with Irrlicht engine, while Vanessa and I did the architecture planning, 3D modelling and texturing.

We learned about a lot of stuff. First, that Irrlicht is sort of hard for beginners. We also learned about outputting stereo images. And, that aiming with your head is a hard task.

There are some few easter eggs on the game: Shooting at the ratio makes the music stop, and some objects are interactive.
