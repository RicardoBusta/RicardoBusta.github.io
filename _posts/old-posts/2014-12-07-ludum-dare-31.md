We participated into Ludum Dare 31.

The chosen theme was _"Entire Game on One Screen"_.
We started thinking on ideas right away. When we decided that we would be participating, the jam had already began.

It was decided we would work with the single screen idea, but it should be subdivided into sectors, and you would have access to each one of them at a time.
We reunited at Fernando's place to develop the game within the 48 remaining hours. And the result can be seen below:
