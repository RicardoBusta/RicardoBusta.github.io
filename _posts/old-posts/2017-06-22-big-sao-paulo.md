We will be travelling tomorrow (23 june 2017) to São Paulo to participate into Big Festival, which will happen next week!
There will be plenty of indie games being showcased there, and we will attempt to show our "Le Petit Shooter" to some people as well.
It would be an enormous favour if you guys could like our social networks and give feedback!
